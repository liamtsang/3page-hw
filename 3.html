            <p>States that could be won by Democrats or Republicans are called swing states. Presidential campaigns are very focused on appealing to voters living in swing states, as their votes in the electoral college are often what decides the election. 
                <br><br>Candidates spend much of their campaigns trying to secure the votes of the people in these states, because if they win even by 1% they get all of the electors. </p>
